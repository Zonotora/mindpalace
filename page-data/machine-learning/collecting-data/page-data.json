This could be observational/historical data. It could be harder to access different types of medias as well, e.g. fiction vs. news. We also have to keep in mind copyright whatever data we choose to collect (only collecting free data will most likely cause a bias as well).</p>\n<p>Samling effects will create different biases (time, selection, demography etc...).</p>\n<h1 id=\"Annotating\">Annotating</h1>\n<p>In the long run it is often useful to create specialized tools for annotating the data to automate the process as much as possible which is greater for scale. It is often easier and less time consuming to annotate with a specialized tool.</p>\n<p>However, we might create a biased user interface</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there might be some easy default</li>\n<li>how are annotators paid (hour or by quantity)?</li>\n<li>interest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There must be a consistent user manual for annotating the data to get samples from the same \"population\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"Semi-automatic-techniques\">Semi-automatic techniques</h2>\n<p>Semi-autmatic techniques are used quite often. They create a bigger data set from a smaller sample. After creation of the bigger data set we could let annotators polish the annotations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Crowdsourcing\">Crowdsourcing</h2>\n<p>When using \n          <span class=\"keyword-link\" id=\"keyword-link-crowdsourcing\">\n          crowdsourcing\n          </span>\n           to annotate the data there are a couple of useful guidelines to keep in mind</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use easy cognitive tasks</li>\n<li>use well-defined tasks</li>\n<li>use concise defintions</li>\n<li>use a low amount of input</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crowdsourcing is often most useful for simplier tasks because non-experts annotate the data.</p>\n<p>We could have more than one annotator per data set to compare the annotations to get better quality annotations.
