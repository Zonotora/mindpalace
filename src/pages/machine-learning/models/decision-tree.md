Decision tree is a classic model of learning and well suited for binary classification. The decision tree is made up of guesses where each node represents a guess and the path to each node the binary decision. Each non-terminal node has two children which corresponds to answering "no" or "yes". The questions can be seen as **_features_** and the rating is called the **_label_**.
