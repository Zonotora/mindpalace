# Null Hypothesis

# Statistically Significant
The result is probably not due to random luck.

# Vector norm
The vector norm is denoted
$$
\| \bold x \|
$$
and may represent any vector norm.

## Absolute-value norm
$$
\| \bold x \| = \| \bold x \|_1 = \sum_{j=1}^{n} | x_j |
$$

## Euclidean norm
$$
\| \bold x \| = \| \bold x \|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j^2}
$$


# Probability space
The probability space consists of three elements: the sample space, the event space and a probability function. The probability function assigns each event in the event space a probability between 0 and 1 where each event maps to a set of outcomes in the sample space.

# Parametric family
A parametric family is a family whose differences only depend in the set of parameters used.
