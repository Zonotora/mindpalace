# UDP
User Datagram Protocol.

# TCP
Transmission Control Protocol.

# RADIUS
Remote Authentication Dial In User Service.

# TTP
Trusted Third Parties.

# Roaming
Roaming is the ability to get wireless network service in an area that differs from the registered home network location.

# Octet
The sequence of 8 bits are called an **octet**. A byte may vary depending on the computer architecture.

# Ciphers
An algorithm to hide information from unauthorized or verify that the information is correctly transmitted.

# Stream ciphers
Stream ciphers operates on one bit at a time. The output is a PRNG. The output stream is XOR:ed with the data to encrypt. Often weak.

# DES
Data Encryption Standard.

# 3-DES
Repeating DES three times with different keys. Is assumed to be safe to use until 2030, but is slow.

# AES
Advanced Encryption Standard.

# RC4
Ron's code 4. Is fast but weak.

# ECB
Electronic Code-Book mode.

# CBC
Cipher Block Chaining mode.

# IV
Initialization vector.

# CTR
Counter mode.

# Asymmetric key encryption
One key is used to encrypt the data, and the other is used to decrypt the data. One of the keys can be public.

# RSA
Rivest, Shamir, Adleman. An encryption algorithm with asymmetric keys.

# ECC
Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

# McEliece
An asymmetric encryption algorithm.

# Lattice-based cryptography
Cryptography that involves lattices, which is a mathematical property defined in geometry and group theory.

# MD5
Message Digest 5. A common hash function.

# SHA-1
Secure hash algorithm.  A common hash function.

# SHA-2
Family name for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. A common hash function.

# SHA-3
The next generation of hash functions.

# HMAC
Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication. A standard for message authentication with MAC.
It involves a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message simultaneously.

# CBC MAC
Cipher Block Chaining MAC.

# Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
Offers a secure way of exchanging keys over an untrusted network, but should be used carefully since we are not sure with whom we may share a key with.

# TLS
Transport Layer Security.

# SSH
Secure Shell.

# IPSec
Internet Protocol Security.

# CA
Certificate Authority.

# PKI
Public Key Infrastructure.

# CRL
Certificate Revocation Lists

# OCSP
Online Certificate Status Protocol.

# MITM
Man in the Middle.

# DoS
Denial of Service.

# DDoS
Distributed Denial of Service.

# Ingress filtering
A technique used to ensure that incoming packets are actually from the network they claim to be.

# Egress filtering
A technique used to control outgoing packets from a network to ensure that unauthorized or malicious traffic never leaves the network.

# ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol.

# NAT
Network Address Translation.

# LSR
Loose source route.

# SSR
Strict source route.

# IDS
Intrusion Detection System.

# SYN
Synchronization flag in TCP segment. Used to initiate a connection between two hosts.

# ACK
Acknowledgement flag in TCP segment. Used to acknowledge a successful transmission of a packet.

# RST
Reset flag in TCP segment. Used to control whenever a segment arrives that does not meet the criteria for a referenced connection.

# RFC
Requests for Comments.

# DMZ
Demilitarized zone.

# Stateless firewalls
Stateless firewalls do not inspect traffic or an entire packet. They only filter packets based on specific rules.

# Stateful firewalls
Stateful firewalls keep track of the state of active network connections while analyzing the traffic looking for malicious activity.

# Proxy server
A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. The request from the client is directed toward the proxy which evaluates the request and passes it forwards. This has benefits like load balancing, privacy and security.

# Screening router
Often used as a perimeter protection for an internal network and performs basic packet filtering.

# ISP
Internet Service Provider.

# Nonce
A nonce is a number that can only be used once in a cryptographic setting. This is to prevent replay attacks. They are often random or pseudo-random numbers.

# DMZ
DMZ stands for demilitarized zone and is sometimes referred to as a perimeter network or screened subnet. It is a subnetwork that exposes companies external services to untrusted larger networks like the internet.

# Spoofing
In a spoofing attack, an attacker successfully identifies as another person by falsifying data.

# NAC
Network access control (NAC) is a solution that defines and implements a security policy based on a set of protocols. This policy is used when a device is connecting to the network.

# DHCP
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows a user to automatically retrieve an IP address in the network as well as other details about the network.

# Port knocking
Port knocking is a method to open ports on the firewall for a specific user based on successfully connecting to a predefined set of closed ports.

# De-perimeterisation
De-perimeterisation is the removal of the boundary between an organization and the outside world. A mixture of approaches is used for security instead of relying on the boundary to the internet.

# The Jericho approach
The Jericho approach was a promotion for de-perimeterisation issued by the Jericho Forum.

# RIP
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest protocols for determining the best route through the internet.

# BGF
Border Gateway Protocol (BGF) is the protocol underlying the global routing system of the internet.

# Clogging
Is a type of DoS attack where an attacker establishes many thousands of connections to a specific host, making them unavailable for other users.



# NAT
Network Address Translation (NAT)

# AP
Access Point.

# WAP
Wireless Access Point.

# SSID
Identifier (name) for the network.

# BSSID
Identifier for access points and their clients. The Access Point MAC address.

# ESSID
It is the same as the SSID but used across multiple different Access Points as a part of the same WLAN.

# BAN logic
Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic (BAN logic) is a set of rules to analyze information exchange protocols.
