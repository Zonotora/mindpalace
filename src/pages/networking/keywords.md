# UDP
User Datagram Protocol.

# TCP
Transmission Control Protocol.

# RADIUS
Remote Authentication Dial In User Service.

# TTP
Trusted Third Parties.

# Roaming
Roaming is the ability to get wireless network service in an area that differs from the registered home network location.

# Octet
The sequence of 8 bits are called an **octet**. A byte may vary depending on the computer architecture.

# Ciphers
An algorithm to hide information from unauthorized or verify that the information is correctly transmitted.


# DES
Data Encryption Standard.

# 3-DES
Repeating DES three times with different keys. Is assumed to be safe to use until 2030, but is slow.

# AES
Advanced Encryption Standard.

# RC4
Ron's code 4. Is fast but weak.

# ECB
Electronic Code-Book mode.

# CBC
Cipher Block Chaining mode.

# CTR
Counter mode.

# Asymmetric key encryption
One key is used to encrypt the data, and the other is used to decrypt the data. One of the keys can be public.

# RSA
Rivest, Shamir, Adleman. An encryption algorithm with asymmetric keys.

# ECC
Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

# McEliece
An asymmetric encryption algorithm.

# Lattice-based cryptography
Cryptography that involves lattices, which is a mathematical property defined in geometry and group theory.

# MD5
Message Digest 5. A common hash function.

# SHA-1
Secure hash algorithm.  A common hash function.

# SHA-2
Family name for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. A common hash function.

# SHA-3
The next generation of hash functions.

# HMAC
Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication. A standard for message authentication with MAC.

# CBC MAC
Cipher Block Chaining MAC.

# Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
Offers a secure way of exchanging keys over an untrusted network, but should be used carefully since we are not sure with whom we may share a key with.

# TLS
Transport Layer Security.

# SSH
Secure Shell.

# IPSec
Internet Protocol Security.

# CA
Certificate Authority.

# PKI
Public Key Infrastructure.

# CRL
Certificate Revocation Lists

# OCSP
Online Certificate Status Protocol.

# MITM
Man in the Middle.

# DoS
Denial of Service.

# DDoS
Distributed Denial of Service.

# Ingress filtering
A technique used to ensure that incoming packets are actually from the network they claim to be.

# Egress filtering
A technique used to control outgoing packets from a network to ensure that unauthorized or malicious traffic never leaves the network.

# ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol.

# NAT
Network Address Translation.

# LSR
Loose source route.

# SSR
Strict source route.

# IDS
Intrusion Detection System.

# SYN
Synchronization flag in TCP segment. Used to initiate a connection between two hosts.

# ACK
Acknowledgement flag in TCP segment. Used to acknowledge a successful transmission of a packet.

# RST
Reset flag in TCP segment. Used to control whenever a segment arrives that does not meet the criteria for a referenced connection.

# RFC
Requests for Comments.

# DMZ
Demilitarized zone.

# Stateless firewalls
Stateless firewalls do not inspect traffic or an entire packet. They only filter packets based on specific rules.

# Stateful firewalls
Stateful firewalls keep track of the state of active network connections while analyzing the traffic looking for malicious activity.

# Proxy server
A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. The request from the client is directed toward the proxy which evaluates the request and passes it forwards. This has benefits like load balancing, privacy and security.

# Screening router
Often used as a perimeter protection for an internal network and performs basic packet filtering.

# ISP
Internet Service Provider.
