# TCP
Transmission Control Protocol.

# RADIUS
Remote Authentication Dial In User Service.

# TTP
Trusted Third Parties.

# Roaming
Roaming is the ability to get wireless network service in an area that differs from the registered home network location.

# Octet
The sequence of 8 bits are called an **octet**. A byte may vary depending on the computer architecture.

# Ciphers
An algorithm to hide information from unauthorized or verify that the information is correctly transmitted.


# DES
Data Encryption Standard.

# 3-DES
Repeating DES three times with different keys. Is assumed to be safe to use until 2030, but is slow.

# AES
Advanced Encryption Standard.

# RC4
Ron's code 4. Is fast but weak.

# ECB
Electronic Code-Book mode.

# CBC
Cipher Block Chaining mode.

# Asymmetric key encryption
One key is used to encrypt the data, and the other is used to decrypt the data. One of the keys can be public.

# RSA
Rivest, Shamir, Adleman. An encryption algorithm with asymmetric keys.

# ECC
Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

# McEliece
An asymmetric encryption algorithm.

Family name for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. A common hash function.

# SHA-3
The next generation of hash functions.

# HMAC
Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication. A standard for message authentication with MAC.

# CBC MAC
Cipher Block Chaining MAC.

# Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
Offers a secure way of exchanging keys over an untrusted network, but should be used carefully since we are not sure with whom we may share a key with.

# Ingress filtering
A technique used to ensure that incoming packets are actually from the network they claim to be.

# Egress filtering
A technique used to control outgoing packets from a network to ensure that unauthorized or malicious traffic never leaves the network.

# ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol.

# NAT
Network Address Translation.

# LSR
Loose source route.

# SSR
