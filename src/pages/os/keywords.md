# Spin lock
A lock that uses busy waiting.

# Synchronization
To make sure that certain event chains do not occur.

# Livelock
A situation where no process is blocked but events are happening with no progress.

# Starvation
A situation where a process run indefinitely but fail to make any progress due to unfairness.

# Deadlock
A situation where all processes are blocked waiting for each other and will remain in that state indefinitely.

# Preemptable resource
A resource that **can** be taken away from another process without any bad effects.

# Nonpreemptable  resource
A resource that **cannot** be taken away from another process without any bad effects.

# Static relocation
A method for relocation every memory address during the load process with a constant, the constant being the first physical memory address the program was loaded into.

# Dynamic relocation
A method for mapping a process' address space onto different phsyical memory parts.

# Memory compaction
A technique to move all processes in memory down as far as possible to avoid memory holes.
